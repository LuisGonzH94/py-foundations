#Your first Python program

Your first Python program is typically a simple "Hello, World!" program, which is a tradition in programming and serves as a basic introduction to the language. Here's how you can create and run your first Python program:

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, you'll need to install Python on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

2. **Choose a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: You can write Python code in any plain text editor, but using an IDE designed for Python can enhance your development experience. Some popular Python IDEs include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and IDLE (which comes bundled with Python).

3. **Write the Code**:

   ```python
   # This is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```

   This code consists of a single line that uses the `print()` function to display the text "Hello, World!".

4. **Save the File**: Save the code in a file with a ".py" extension. For example, you can save it as "hello.py".

5. **Run the Program**:
   
   - Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the program by typing `python hello.py` and pressing Enter. You should see "Hello, World!" displayed on the screen.

That's it! You've successfully created and run your first Python program. This basic example demonstrates how to use the `print()` function to display output in Python, which is a fundamental concept in programming. You can build on this knowledge to explore more advanced Python programming topics and projects.
